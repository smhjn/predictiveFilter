predictiveFilter
================

Fourier statistical filter for time series data. Not production ready by any means.

Super basic rev-1-just-working-for-test-case-mode-now status. Undocumented and all that too. 

run `make` in top directory to create binaries and libraries

then run the MacTest.py and see how it works.
