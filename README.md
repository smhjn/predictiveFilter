predictiveFilter
================

Fourier statistical filter for time series data. Not production ready by any means.

You'll need to `pip install cython distutils numpy scipy` and maybe some others

Requries the epic FFTW library: http://www.fftw.org/

Installs easily enough on Mac/Ubuntu: `brew install fftw3` or `apt-get install fftw3`

Super basic rev-1-just-working-for-test-case-mode-now status. Undocumented and all that too. 

run `make` in top directory to create binaries and libraries

then run the MacTest.py and see how it works.
